<p>A&nbsp;<em>binary gap</em>&nbsp;within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of N.</p>
<p>For example, number 9 has binary representation&nbsp;<tt>1001</tt>&nbsp;and contains a binary gap of length 2. The number 529 has binary representation&nbsp;<tt>1000010001</tt>&nbsp;and contains two binary gaps: one of length 4 and one of length 3. The number 20 has binary representation&nbsp;<tt>10100</tt>&nbsp;and contains one binary gap of length 1. The number 15 has binary representation&nbsp;<tt>1111</tt>&nbsp;and has no binary gaps. The number 32 has binary representation&nbsp;<tt>100000</tt>&nbsp;and has no binary gaps.</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><tt>def solution(N)</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>that, given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest binary gap. The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.</p>
<p>For example, given N = 1041 the function should return 5, because N has binary representation&nbsp;<tt>10000010001</tt>&nbsp;and so its longest binary gap is of length 5. Given N = 32 the function should return 0, because N has binary representation '100000' and thus no binary gaps.</p>
<p>Write an&nbsp;<strong>efficient</strong>&nbsp;algorithm for the following assumptions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>N is an integer within the range [<span class="number">1</span>..<span class="number">2,147,483,647</span>].</li>
</ul>
